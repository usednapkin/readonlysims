*the worst version to date!*

this is a basic version of the sims that's read only and has no graphics. you can't edit the sims or choose what they do, they're just acting autonomously.

## current features
- generate a household full of mostly-unique sims with their own name, age, pronouns & career
- elders and children can't work, and teens have a 50-50 chance of going to school or having a job
- sims can have hard-coded partners & best friends

## planned features, and stuff
### currently implementing:
- objects & needs system
  - unique & randomly generated objects for each need
  - each sim has six needs that decay over time

### concerns for future me
- **objects will help sims relieve their needs**
  - every 20 ticks (in-game minutes) every sim will assess their needs and see whats nearby that can help them, if they need it
  - priority system for bladder, hunger, sleep etc - theyll focus on the more important ones
- **relationship system**
  - sims will have relationships such as partner, best friend & family trees
  - sims will be able to have interactions, choose their own partners & best friends
- **money system**
  - your sims will be able to make money.
  - money pays for bills.
  - i dont know what your sims will be able to do with money. not like YOU can buy anything for them!
- **age-up system over time**
  - every week your sims will grow up a life stage...
  - they grow up so fast :')
- **save system so you can keep playing with the same sims between sessions**
  - a game over system for when you've got none left too
- **babies and toddlers**
    - honestly this could be done right now it's just difficult to manage

## the footer? idk

yes this project was very much inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gf2MT-IOsg&t=459s">this video,</a> but i also have about ~3.6k hours in the sims 4 and i need something more productive to do with my time. also wanted to try and engineer an entire ai simulation from an overview of how fake computer people behave  

this also is absolutely not endorsed by real sims games in any way please don't sue me i'm a bored zoomer that needs to learn java for classes :']
